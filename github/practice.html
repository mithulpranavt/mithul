      A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and
      are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do
      that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.
      This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an
      essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the
      essay and grasp its main points.Paragraphs can contain many different
      kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples
      or a single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a
      place, character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or
      contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe
      causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain,
      all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of the most important of
      these is a topic sentence.

        Most paragraphs in an essay have a three-part structure introduction,
        body, and conclusion. You can see this structure in paragraphs whether
        they are narrating, describing, comparing, contrasting, or analyzing
        information. Each part of the paragraph plays an important role in
        communicating your meaning to your reader.
